    "The dataset under analysis consists of investment portfolio information related to both holdings and issuers, encompassing several dimensions such as portfolio type, teams, status (realized/unrealized), and financial entities. The dataset is structured in 16 columns, including critical financial and categorical data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portfolio Type:** Differentiates between holdings and issuers.\n",
    "- **Team:** Represents different teams handling the holdings and issuers.\n",
    "- **Status:** Indicates whether an investment has been realized or remains unrealized.\n",
    "- **Reporting Name/Investment Name:** Captures details about the specific investments, firms, and vehicles involved.\n",
    "- **Security Number:** A unique identifier for each security in the portfolio.\n",
    "- **Entity (Investor):** Details the individuals or firms responsible for the investments.\n",
    "- **Date:** Represents the investment date.\n",
    "- **Net Cash Flows:** Captures the cash flow associated with each transaction.\n",
    "- **Investment Fund/Vehicle:** Specifies the name of the fund or vehicle involved in the investments.\n",
    "- **ROW_NUMBER:** Provides a unique identifier for each row in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset contains 1.048.575 million rows, including duplicate entries, which will be cleaned during the analysis. Our goal is to reduce the dataset to approximately 35,000 rows by eliminating duplicates, filtering for relevant records, and ensuring data consistency. The dataset will then be saved into a new CSV file for further use.\n",
