# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

## What Data Are We Exploring Today?

The dataset under analysis consists of **investment portfolio information** related to both holdings and issuers. It encompasses multiple dimensions such as portfolio type, teams, status (realized/unrealized), and financial entities. 

The dataset is structured with **16 columns**, capturing critical financial and categorical data, including:

- **Portfolio Type**: Differentiates between holdings and issuers.
- **Team**: Represents the different teams managing the holdings and issuers.
- **Status**: Indicates whether an investment has been realized or remains unrealized.
- **Reporting Name/Investment Name**: Captures details about specific investments, firms, and vehicles involved.
- **Security Number**: A unique identifier for each security in the portfolio.
- **Entity (Investor)**: Details the individuals or firms responsible for the investments.
- **Date**: Represents the investment date.
- **Net Cash Flows**: Records the cash flow associated with each transaction.
- **Investment Fund/Vehicle**: Specifies the name of the fund or vehicle involved in the investments.
- **ROW_NUMBER**: Provides a unique identifier for each row in the dataset.

### Dataset Overview
- **Initial Size**: 1,048,575 rows, including duplicate entries.
- **Objective**: Reduce the dataset to approximately **35,000 rows** by:
  - Removing duplicates.
  - Filtering for relevant records.
  - Ensuring data consistency.
- **Output**: A cleaned dataset saved into a new CSV file for further use.
